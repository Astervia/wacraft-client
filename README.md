## üß™ Getting Started

### üì¶ Environment Variables

Create your `.env` file:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

Fill in your credentials and other required values. Descriptions for each variable are included in `example.env`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't skip variables or remove them unless you're sure.**

### üê≥ Running with Docker (Recommended for production)

Build the image and run with

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name wacraft-client \
  --env-file .env \
  -p 80:80 \
  wacraft-client:latest
```

The application is behind an Nginx reverse proxy, which is configured to serve the application on port 80, so you'll have access to i18n features with this configuration.

### Running with Angular CLI (Recommended for development)

Simply hit

```bash
ng serve
```

You can explore `--configuration=production` and `--configuration=development` for different build configurations.

## Deploy

### Vercel

You can straightforwardly deploy the application to Vercel. Just create a new project and link it to this repository. Fill the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard and let the configurations on the project do the rest.

## i18n

To extract an i18n file, run the following command:

```bash
ng extract-i18n --output-path src/locale
```

## üêã Docker Image

### üî® Build Instructions

To support private modules when building the Docker image, use SSH forwarding:

```bash
docker build --ssh default -t wacraft-client:latest -f Dockerfile .
```
